# Melodaze

Melodaze is a Flutter-based music application. This project demonstrates a modern music player UI, audio playback, and integration with various assets.

## Features

- Beautiful, responsive music player UI
- Audio playback functionality
- Artist and album images
- Cross-platform support (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop)
- Organized code structure with models, services, and components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)
- A suitable IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/melodaze.git
   cd melodaze
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

## Project Structure

- `lib/` - Main Dart source code
- `assets/` - Images, audio, and other assets
- `test/` - Unit and widget tests
- `android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, `windows/`, `macos/`, `linux/` - Platform-specific code

## Development Process

1. **Project Initialization:**  
   The project was bootstrapped using the Flutter CLI, setting up the initial directory structure and configuration files.

2. **UI/UX Design:**  
   The user interface was designed to be visually appealing and intuitive, using Flutter widgets and custom themes. Assets such as images and audio files were added to the `assets/` directory and referenced in `pubspec.yaml`.

3. **Core Functionality:**  
   The main features, such as audio playback and navigation between screens, were implemented in the `lib/` directory. Code was organized into pages, models, services, and components for maintainability.

4. **Cross-Platform Support:**  
   Platform-specific directories (`android/`, `ios/`, etc.) were configured to ensure the app runs smoothly on multiple platforms.

5. **Testing:**  
   Basic widget and unit tests were added in the `test/` directory to ensure core functionality works as expected.

6. **Version Control:**  
   The project is managed using Git, with a `.gitignore` file to exclude build artifacts and IDE-specific files.

7. **Deployment:**  
   The app can be run on emulators or real devices using `flutter run`. For production, follow Flutter's official build and deployment guides for each platform.

## Assets

All images and audio files used by the app are located in the `assets/` directory and referenced in `pubspec.yaml`.
